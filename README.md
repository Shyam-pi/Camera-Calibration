# Common step:
Open the project folder 'shyampi_proj3' in VSCode, such that it becomes the root directory (important for reading and saving images in problem 2)

# Steps for Problem 1:
1. The code corresponding to problem 1 is in prob1.py
2. Execute the prob1.py file by simply pressing the run button in vscode or by using the 'python3 prob1.py' command in the terminal.
3. The P matrix, Normalized P matrix, Normalized intrinsic matrix, rotation matrix, and the translation vectors are printed in the terminal, followed by the reprojection error for each point.

# Steps for Problem 2:
1. The code corresponding to problem 2 is in prob2.py
2. Execute the prob2.py file by simply pressing the run button in vscode or by using the 'python3 prob2.py' command in the terminal.
3. An openCV window opens up showing a quick slideshow of the images with the corner detections, followed by printing the K matrix and the per image reprojection error.
4. The corner detection outputs can be visualized by opening the saved images in the 'Results' folder.

*Note* If step 2 for problem 2 throws an error kindly check which folder has been opened as the root folder in vscode.
